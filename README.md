cigFaciesNet is an open source code created by the [Computational Interpretation Group (CIG)](http://cig.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) 
for "cigFacies: a massive-scale benchmark dataset of seismic facies and its application".
[Hui Gao](http://cig.ustc.edu.cn/hui/list.htm), [Xinming Wu](http://cig.ustc.edu.cn/xinming/list.htm), [Xiaoming Sun](http://cig.ustc.edu.cn/xiaoming/list.htm) and 
Mingcai Hou are the main contributors to the code. 

This publicly available code contains three strategies of field seismic data curation, 
knowledge-guided synthesization and AI-based generation we proposed for building the benmark dataset, 
as well as training a network and then apply it for automatic siesmic facies classification 
on the validation datasets and two distinct 3-D field seismic data.

The benchmark dataset of seismic facies ([cigFacies](https://zenodo.org/records/10777460)) constructed by these three strategies 
has been uploaded to Zenodo and are freely available at https://zenodo.org/records/10777460
